# E.B.Honeyblossom

An author who writes in the magical realism style. Wildly successful.

Favourite author of Carmichael.

Originally met the gang when they crashed a party she was attending. Somehow she decided she likes us enough to stick around, it seems she's an old friend of Brixton Dapper (possibly an old flame even (????)).

Currently spending a lot of time at The Lodge, but it's unknown if she's living there or just visiting. She has taken over Carmichaels room and he's too shy/nice to do anything about it and is currently sleeping in a little space he made by gently pushing her things around.

Her bodyguard is incredibly capable Annie.
