# Annie

Bodyguard and maid of the author E.B. Honeyblossom.

Annie is never seen far from her charge, quietly making E.B. Honeyblossom's life easier. An intensely private person, the party don't know any of her personal details, including her last name.

Carmichael has a huge crush on her but has not yet been able to muster up the courage to speak to her.
