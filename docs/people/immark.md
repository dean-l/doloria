# Immark

As both a halfling and a little girl Immark is extordinarily small and cute. Although the sweetest little girl that could possibly be she holds a fasination for all things dark and macabre.

Her break out novel "Transendance" (a story from the perspective of a tree that's being burnt down) was so horrifying that elven society had it banned.

She's also a great lover or pranks and traps, as Iuris found out when he was almost cut in half while trying to save her.

Immark is now a good friend of the party and has even put her traps to use around the lodge, helping secure it.

She can often be found in the greenhouse of the lodge having a tea party with Thia.
