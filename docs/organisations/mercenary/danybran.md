# Al'Diarmaid Danybran

Toting themselves as the voice of the common man, Al'Diarmaid Danybran are an extremist organisation of fighters, angry with the bureocracy and politics of Doloria. willing to take the law into their own hands and dispense justice as they see fit.

## History and Operation

After the Capital War, most Puritans conceded and were reassured in the Arcanus Legis that mages would from now on be held accountable for their actions. However, a few saw their defeat as unjust and a result of corrupt authorities taking advantage of the common folk and would not give up their fight. Lead by a zealous and relatable leader Diarmaid, they formed a citizen's militia to take control and destroy the oppressive and controlling government, nobility and upper class.

## The Danybran

A Danybran is a brutal and distinctive weapon carried by most members, resembling a long, thin club. Legislation passed after the war made it illegal for any non military or guard to carry a weapon, with specific rules as to what would constitute as one. Farmers and tradesmen still had to carry their tools and with strict checks and patrols so fought with whatever they could find. Originally made from the timber handles of axes and picks, they are now purpose made as a symbol of loyalty to the cause, stained red with blood.
