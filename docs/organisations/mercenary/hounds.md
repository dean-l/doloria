# The Hounds

![](/doloria/img/hounds.png)

The Royal Hounds and Hunters of the Duchy of Clemens, more commonly referred to as simply The Hounds is an organisation of hunters and trackers working closely with the Triumvirate to pursue and capture outlawed mages for trial.

The current leader of the Hounds and the Duchy of Clemens is Duke Chesterfield Clemens, currently in his third year of the position. His father, the late Duke Bertram Alistair Clemens was fatally injured by the outlawed mage Ollphest while attempting his capture. Ollphest escaped into the wilderness and the new Duke and his brothers were left to lead the family after the death of his father.

The Hounds operate out of Clemensworth, the family estate several miles east of Verum and have barracks in the capital and in most major settlements.

The Clemens brothers are:

| Duke Chesterfield Bertram Clemens | Earl Cadbury Byron Clemens | Earl Clifford Bartholemew Clemens | Earl Chauncey Burton Clemens |  Earl Cornelius Basil Clemens |

## History and Operation

Originally an influential noble house, a disdain for users of magic started to form when an remarkably few number of the family manifested magic from the Birth of the Weave. While most families eventually saw the power in a magic bloodline, the Clemens ostracised those that were “impure”. Tensions between the magic and non magic communities eventually resulted in The Capital War, with the Clemens fighting on the side of the Puritans. With the end of the war and the drafting of Arcanus Legis, the Clemens found themselves suited and well equipped as an organisation for the capture of outlawed mages.

The Hounds run in 4 man teams, usually with several blink dogs and the Huntsmaster carrying the Orders of Capture. High ranking hounds carry a Huntsmaster’s Crossbow, a Gnome engineered specialty crossbow. It fires an incredibly powerful bolt for it’s size, which can be easily be concealed by their large coats.
