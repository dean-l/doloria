# Civis Arcanum

Civis Arcanum is the order created in the Arcanus Legis to represent and demarginalise magically gifted people. Based in Verum, It contains members of all major religions and all magically gifted races in cities and towns all over the nation. As an organisation, they hold no direct political power, but are a respected advisory body and a popular community organisation. They also act as a school to educate newly gifted mages on the control and use of magic.
