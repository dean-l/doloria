# Bleeding Hearts

With artists and performers streching accross the continent, Bleeding Hearts is the premier bard's guild, whose stamp carries a guarantee of breathtaking performances and unforgettable nights. The guild is a mark of credibility and artistic standard for its members and its influence among society is a strong deterrent to any unscrupulous patron that would take advantage of its services.

The Marquee, located in the southern Verum district of Quayside, is the organisational home of the guild and also large entertainment precinct that draws large crowds from the city every night.
