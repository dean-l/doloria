# Elves

*Communities in the elven culture usually have a single name for all references to them, due to deep traditional roots and a lack of most prepositions, i.e. The Vaulted Court is both the floating halls and the council within, elves from Syndoril will refer to themselves and family as "being Syndoril"

Elven writing is filled with accents, diacritics and ligatures, with even slight visual variations changing the entire meaning of a sentences

Elves will usually have a signature comprising of parts of their name in a unique, representative glyph, akin to a monogram
