# Dwarves

Signage in dwarven communities consists entirely of proudly displayed prayers and tributes, due to a longstanding superstition about forsaking the gods for one's own material gain. A prayer for good soil and a bountiful harvest, will probably adorn a seller of produce, making finding what you are looking for somewhat easier.
