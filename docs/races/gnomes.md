# Gnomes

The gnomes are a proud and successful race, constantly striving to better one another through personal progress. Gnomes consider their entire race as a family and value invention and innovation over all. Those that prove themselves as keen students and remarkable creators are often welcomed into higher ranking families and take a new surname. Similarly, all gnomes have the choice to leave a higher ranking family for a simpler life, usually for a profession or ambition. The Vitruvians represent the most brilliant and influential of the gnomes and acceptance to them is a historic and momentous occasion. Gnomes that commit serious crimes against the community are stripped of their surname and most leave gnomish society as a result.

The long and usually convoluted gnomish names are a result of families combining, as processes and industries become more complex, using bits of each surname involved in the process, eg the bookbinding family Zandinkkerandunar are decendendants of the papermaking Dunars, the leatherworking Zands, the stitcher Kerands and the gilding Dinkkers

The Vitruvians are the ruling power in gnomish society, originally descended from the gnomish champion, Galivox Vitruvian.
