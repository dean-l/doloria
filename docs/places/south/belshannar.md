# Bel'Shanaar

![](/doloria/img/belshanaar.jpg)

The slender towers of the High Elven city Bel’Shanaar rise effortlessly from the cliffs, grazing the ever-present mist of the Aenarion mountain range. Graceful arches swoop from spire to spire, their faintly rose-hued stonework marbled with gold and silver.

While they may be found in towns and cities across the realm, Bel’Shanaar is the only official High Elf city. The surrounding mountains are dotted with pristine gardens and winding carved stone and marble paths, connecting the sprawl of homesteads, artisan schools and various other Elven retreats.

High above floats the Vaulted Court, both the political and physical seat of power in the region.
