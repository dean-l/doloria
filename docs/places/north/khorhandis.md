# Khorhandis

![](/doloria/img/khorhandis.jpg)

Far to the north, at the frozen edge of the Ulkan Lok stands the independant city of Khorhandis. Home to most drow in Doloria and refugees form all over, Knorhandis is varied in culture and influence, but holds a strong traditional leadership within the White Palace.
