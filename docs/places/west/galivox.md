# Galivox

![](/doloria/img/galivox.jpg)

Galivox is an underground settlement on the Broken Coast and the largest Gnomish community in Doloria.

Gnomes were a subterranean race for most of Doloria’s history and lived in caves and caverns scattered along it’s southern coast. After the Birth of the Weave and the power of magic started to grow, significant weather changes began to occur all over Doloria. Large sandstorms began appearing on the Broken Coast most with little to no warning. These sandstorms would generate devastating lightning, destroying many small settlements. While most fled for safer environments, the decendants of Galivox Vitruvian, remained in the harsh environment with a plan to harness the power of the storms and utilise its energy. Through decades of research and many casualities, those that remained built a city under the red sand and named it in honour of their great leader.

Galivox and most of gnomish society is governed by the Vitruvians and other high ranking families in small committees, each tasked to govern an aspect of the local society, such as education, farming, law and order.
