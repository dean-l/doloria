# Draconic Fall

As magic began to manifest in the common folk after the Birth of the Weave, the dragons continued to tighten their grip on their territories. Quick to quell any resistance, the dragons made a show of destroying towns and villages that they deemed to be a threat. A young paladin named Helena Dolor gathered others that had been displaced to take up arms and fight the elder dragons that had been terrorising the continent. Commanding a divine bolt from the heavens, the dragons fell and the army retrieved a vast wealth that had been taken from them.
